After you pull the image from github, you should first change your working directory to
./Backend folder, after that run:

    docker build -t flaskappback .

inside your terminal.

after it succesfully creates the image, navigate to the ./Frontend folder in this directory and run:

    docker build -t flaskappfront .

to create the other image. after it is also succesfull, you can go back to the root directory of this folder that contains docker-compose.yaml file.


After making sure everything in you docker-compose.yaml file seems good, and you changed the ports etc. to your liking.

run:

    docker-compose up -d

in your terminal.

After every container is started, you can use the Restournat reservation demo on your web browser by going to:

    http://localhost:8000
